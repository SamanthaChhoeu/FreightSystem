<h2>Freight Transport System
</h2>
This assignment is inspired by the problem faced by a small trucking company moving freight
around Australia, making optimal use of a single truck. The aim is to schedule an optimal route
for the truck to complete a joblist (set of jobs), where the truck completes one job at a time.
While all the jobs on the joblist need to be included in the final route, the journey may
include additional (multiple) road trips from the end of one job to the start of the next job.
Assume that the truck can be run continuously (perhaps with different drivers), so your system
can focus on scheduling an optimal route.<br>
<br>
More precisely, a joblist contains a number of distinct specified jobs. The jobs on this list
can be scheduled in any order, but the first job always starts in Sydney. The aim is to minimize
the total cost for the journey, taking into account travel costs between towns and a cost for
unloading each job. For simplicity, the name of each town will be just one word. Assume also
that the travel cost between any two towns is the same in either direction (so need only be
specified in one direction), and that if such a cost is not specified, it is not possible
to travel between the towns in one trip. However, all jobs on the joblist will be between towns
that <em>are</em> directly connected. Furthermore, assume the following "triangle inequality"
on travel costs: for any towns A, B and C, the travel cost from A to C is always less than
or equal to the travel cost from A to B plus the travel cost from B to C.<br>
<br>
In this assignment, you will implement an A* search procedure for the freight
transport system. In your program design, make use of the <span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>Strategy
</big></span>pattern to supply a heuristic to the search procedure, and
don't forget to ensure that your heuristic is admissible.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Implementing A* is the main requirement
for this assignment, so that your program is guaranteed to produce an
optimal solution. If your program does not always produce an
optimal solution (when there is a solution), it is wrong.</span><br>
<br>
Assessment will be based on the design of your program in addition to
correctness. You should submit at least a UML class diagram used for
the design of your program, i.e. not generated from code afterwards.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">All</span> input will be a sequence of lines of the following
form, and all towns and costs will be declared before the joblist:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>Unloading &lt;cost&gt; &lt;town&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Unloading cost is &lt;cost&gt; in &lt;town&gt;<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Cost &lt;cost&gt; &lt;town1&gt; &lt;town2&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Travel cost is &lt;cost&gt; from &lt;town1&gt; to &lt;town2&gt;<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Job &lt;town1&gt; &lt;town2&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Joblist includes a job from &lt;town1&gt; to &lt;town2&gt;<br>
</span></span></big></span>
<br>
Create all your Java source files in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">default package</span>.
Call your main Java file <span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>FreightSystem.java</big></span>.
Read input from a file whose name is passed as an argument to the main
method in the call to <span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>java
FreightSystem</big></span> and print output to <span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>System.out</big></span>.
For machine marking, the output will be redirected to a text file that will
be compared to the expected output (so do not print out extra spaces,
etc.) <span style="font-weight: bold;">and remember to close the input file</span>.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For the purposes of machine marking, problems
will be used for which there is only one optimal solution, though in the case
of multiple optimal solutions, your program should produce one of them.</span><br>
<br>
To read input from a text file (whose name should be passed as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">command line</span>
argument to java, e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>java FreightSystem input.txt</big></span>),
use code such as:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scanner sc = null;</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
try</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; sc = new Scanner(new
FileReader(args[0]));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # args[0] is the
first command line argument</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {}</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
finally</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; if (sc != null) sc.close();</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}</big></span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<p></p>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample Input</span></big><br>
<br>
Below is an example of the input form and meaning. Note that you will
have to submit at least three input test files with your assignment.
These test files should include one or more comments to specify what
scenario is being tested. However, the following sample input includes
many comments added only to explain the input format; your input test files
do not need to contain this many comments.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Unloading cost is 120 in Sydney<br>

</big></span><br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample Output</span></big><br>
<br>
The above example does not have a unique optimal solution. One valid output corresponding to the above input
is as follows. The first line in the output should give the number of nodes <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;"><big>n</big></span>
expanded in your search, the number of nodes taken <span style="font-weight: bold;">off</span> the queue,
which will vary according to the heuristic used. If there is a solition to the problem, the second line
of the output should give the cost of the solution found as an integer, which is the total cost,
and should be the same regardless of the heuristic and the solution path. The remainder of the
output should give a sequence of trips that make up an optimal solution, shown as either a job
(for a required job on the joblist) or as empty (for trips between jobs when the truck is empty).
If your program produces a different optimal solution from the one shown (with the same cost)
then it is correct. If there is no solution to the problem, the second line of the output should
just be <span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>No solution</big></span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><big><span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> nodes expanded<br>
cost = 2320<br>
Job Sydney to Bathurst<br>
Empty Bathurst to Dubbo<br>
Job Dubbo to Grafton<br>
Job Grafton to Wagga<br>
Empty Wagga to Sydney<br>
Job Sydney to Wagga<br>
